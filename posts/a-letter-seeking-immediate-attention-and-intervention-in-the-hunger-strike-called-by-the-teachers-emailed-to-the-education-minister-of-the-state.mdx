To
Shri Kunga Nima Lecha
Hon'ble Education Minister, Govt. of Sikkim
Tashiling Secretariat, Gangtok

Dated: 5th September 2021

Subject: Request for the immediate intervention in the demand
of Ad-hoc teachers.

Honourable sir,
This is to bring to your kind attention that Ad-hoc teachers
have been staging dharna at the DAC, Sichey from past two days
putting forth their demand of temporary extension till the
walk-in interview is completed. Five of them are in indefinite
hunger strikes. The health of those in hunger strike is
deteriorating rapidly.

The shortage of teachers in government schools across the Sikkim
is evident to everyone. The termination of terms of the Ad hoc
teachers who were appointed last year have left many students
in trouble,  especially class 10 and 12 students whose board
exam is in November-December this year. In such backdrop, a
large number of students are bound to study some subjects
themselves due to unavailability of the subject teachers.
Those studying in schools far away from capital are the worse
victims of this. Such students are mostly the students whose
parents are economically weak. As most of the Ad-hoc teachers
are engaged in rural and remote schools.

Some teachers whose terms terminated are still teaching on
the humanitarian grounds.

Although the Sikkim State Teachers Recruiting Board (SSTRB)
has announced the date for walk-in-interviews to start from
Oct 3, 2021, it is also evident that the completion of the
same may take months. Therefore, the schools are bound to
suffer from shortage of teacher for several months. Also,
there is a question of livelihood for hundreds of teachers
and their families. Moreover, teachers are one of the most
important components of the society with a pivotal role in
society's progress, the continued suffering of the teachers
in the eve of national teachers day has brought great harm
in the image of our state in front of the whole world.
Thus, we request you to kindly intervene in this manner and
fulfil the following single point demand:

Give extension to the teachers who were teaching earlier in
their respective schools until the walk-in-interviews  and
other formalities are completed by SSTRB.

We hope you will intervene in this matter and fulfil the
demands of the teachers thereby ending their protest and
hunger strike. This will be a gift from the Govt of Sikkim
to all the Ad-hoc teachers of the state who sacrifice their
prime age of their lives at a meagre salary and no security
for the sake of teaching the children of underprivileged
Sikkimese.

Thanking you

Yours,
Executive members
Sikkim Progressive Youth Forum
